  {\skill Project management}\\
  {\desc
    Independently planned and performed a 2.5-year-long physics analysis.
    Involved long-term planning and prioritisation of tasks to ensure that the analysis
    was completed within the timeline of the PhD.
  }\\[\interskillspacing]
  {\skill Teamwork and communication}\\
  {\desc
    Collaborated on many projects with colleagues at the University of
    Birmingham and internationally. Worked on an analysis with a team of
    $\sim$10 physicists to attain a world-leading result, meeting weekly to
    share updates with the team and distribute tasks. During a 1-year placement
    at CERN during the PhD, joined the L1Calo operations team and took week-long
    24/7 on-call shifts to solve problems during data-taking runs.
  }\\[\interskillspacing]
  {\skill Time management}\\
  {\desc
    Worked on many simultaneous projects during the PhD and learned to
    effectively split time between tasks, whilst also scheduling individual work
    time around meetings and other commitments.
  }\\[\interskillspacing]
  {\skill Leadership}\\
  {\desc
    During undergraduate studies, led a group of 14 students for a 3-month
    project, producing a 90-page document on the design of high-energy particle detectors.
    Leadership responsibilities included dividing and delegating tasks amongst
    small teams, setting deadlines, and organising and chairing regular
    meetings.
    Also took on leading roles in organising events such as a group Christmas
    dinner in Birmingham and a BBQ to welcome new arrivals to placement at CERN.
  }\\[\interskillspacing]
  {\skill Problem solving} \\
  {\desc
    As a physicist, problem solving is an essential skill, used in deriving
    solutions to mathematical problems, in implementing code to analyse very large
    datasets or simulate systems, and in optimising an analysis to best extract
    a result from data.
